Scanning for bluetooth device
$ hcitool scan

Scanning ...
20:13:05:02:01:89 HC-05

HC-05 don't seems to have SDP (service discovery protocol), don't bother
scanning for services with sdptool

Just connect using rfcomm, this command will create /dev/rfcomm0 character
device

$ sudo rfcomm -r bind rfcomm0 20:13:05:02:01:89

-r is for raw connection, if not rfcomm will send "AT+GCAP" once it is connect

When the device is used, it will automatically connect when the device is
opened

$ cat /dev/rfcomm0

Another way is to connect directly:

$ sudo rfcomm -r connect rfcomm0 20:13:05:02:01:89
Connected /dev/rfcomm0 to 20:13:05:02:01:89 on channel 1
Press CTRL-C for hangup

Then in another terminal, use screen to connect:

$ screen /dev/rfcomm0

This will release the device

$ sudo rfcomm release rfcomm0
